OVERVIEW:

This program deals with character recognition of images taken from Google Street view (GSV) using SVM technique. We approach the problem by first cleaning and transforming the GSV images to a computational friendly format. Then the resulting dataset is split into training and validating datasets. A suitable SVM model is formulated using the training dataset. The validating dataset is used to fine tune the generated model. The fine-tuned model is used for predicting the final output.


CHARACTER RECOGNITION:

Character recognition is a common technique of digitizing printed data, which outcomes in data being electronically edited, searched, stored compactly, displayed on-line, and used in processes such as machine translation, text-to- speech, key data and text mining. Character recognition is done using a competent calculation algorithm like SVM using a high level computational language similar to R.


PROGRAMMING with R:

R is a powerful, high level computational language. It is one of the most sought after language for enormous data extraction. This is primarily due to the fact that R is an open source language plus has a large number of inherent libraries with enormous statistical applications.


WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM DO:

This program written in R, performs the character recognition of the images taken from Google Street View using the Support Vector Machine technique.
